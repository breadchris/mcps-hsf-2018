    <p>MCPS HSF is happening on March 13th! This is supposedly modeled after the CSAW HSF competition I mentioned before. I can't wait for it! I will definitely make another post about it later.</p>

    <p>So I just realized the cash royale forums website has a big vulnerability. That's why I removed all of my confidential information from the profile page. Thanks to CTFs for teaching me the knowledge to find this vuln! If anyone reading this uses the forums, be sure to remove sensitive information too. Stay cool and Cash on!</p>

    <p>Apparently Cash Royale has a <a href="http://162.243.161.80">forums</a> site! A bunch of my classmates use it. Join the community if you also play Cash</p>

    <p>I found this really big cyber competition: https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/hsf. This is more focused around forensics though... I tried it and I did horribly :(<br>I encourage you guys to try it next year too!</p>

    <p>Wow, these Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions seems really interesting? Basically, these are educational competitions that teach cyber security, and is usually grouped into the following categories: Web, Reversing, Forensics, Cryptography, and Binary Exploitation.</p>
